# OVM-PK Product Requirements

## Core Functionality

### Physics-Aware Docking
- Replicate experimental affinity (Ki) and ΔG
- Support pluggable docking physics modules
- Enable head-to-head baseline comparisons

### Success Criteria
1. Replication accuracy:
   - |ΔG_pred − ΔG_exp| ≤ 1.5–2.0 kcal/mol median
   - Pearson r ≥ 0.5 between predicted and experimental ΔG

2. New physics improvements:
   - Statistically significant better correlation
   - Lower error vs baseline
   - Reproducible results
